    The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
    different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
    - The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
    - Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
    - To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
    (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed which is available free from Google.


# Introduction to CSS layout MDN
    CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.  The page layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module are

        Normal flow
        The display property
        Flexbox
        Grid
        Floats
        Positioning
        Table layout
        Multiple-column layout

    Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages, and no technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what each method is designed for you will be in a good place to understand which is the best layout tool for each task.

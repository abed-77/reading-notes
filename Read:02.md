# Text 

    HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
    the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
        
    They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
    emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
    acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)

# Introducing CSS 
    Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
    
     There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
     Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
    
     It is important to ensure that there is enough contrastbetween any text and the background color (otherwisepeople will not be able to read your content).

    CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
    
    CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.



# Basic JavaScript Instuction

    A script is made up of series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

    Scripts contain very percise instructions. For example, you might specify that value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

    Variable ae used to temporarily store more than one pice of related information.

    Arrays ae special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 

    Javascript distinguishes between numbers (0-9) strings (text), boolean values (true or false).

    expressions evaluate into single value.

    Expression relyon operators to calculate a value.

## Decisions and Loops

    Conditional statement allow your cade to make decisions about what to do next

    Comparison operators (===. !==, ==, !=, >, <, <=, =>) ae used to compare two operators.

    if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if the condition is true, and another if false.

    Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

    All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy

    There are three types of loop: for, while, and do...while, Each repeats a set of statements

# Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)

    - Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.
    -The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.
    - Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
    - Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
    - HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.

# Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)

    - List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
    - Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
    - Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
    - Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

# Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)
    - Event are the browser's way of indicating when something has happend (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked)
    - Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.
    - When event occurs on am element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.
    - You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
    - The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, altough there are others in the HTML5 specification as well as browser-specific events.

    - DOM Events are sent to notify code of interesting things that have taken place. Each event is represented by an object which is based on the Event interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions used to get additional information about what happened. Events can represent everything from basic user interactions to automated notifications of things happening in the rendering model.

# Domain Modeling 

    Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

   - When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
    -Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
    -Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
   - Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
   - Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
    -Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

# Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)

    - The <table> element is used to add tables to a webpage.
    - A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
    with the <tr> element.
    - Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header).
    - You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
    - For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

    - Function allow you to group a set of related statement together that represent a single task.
    - Function can take parameters (information required to do thier job) and may return a value.
    - An object is a series of variable and functions that represent something from the world around you.
    In an object, variables are known as properties of the object, function are method of the object.
    -Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and document loaded into browser window.
    - JS also has several built-in object such as String,Number,Math< and date. thier properties and methods offer functionality that helps you write scripts.
    Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
